This directory contains XSLT transformations.

Third-party transformations are included in subdirectories:

  * exslt-templates/
  * xsltl/


Previous versions of templates that can either be deleted, or that we
may wish to revive in some form or other:

  * retired/


Boilerplate and templates with named transforms are prefixed with 'xmlqstat-':

  * xmlqstat-masthead.xsl
  * xmlqstat-templates.xsl


In general, the naming convention 'SOURCE-DEST.xsl' is chosen.
If a particular rendering mode cannot be easily dealt within the same
transformation, the naming convention 'SOURCE-MODE-DEST.xsl' is used.


  * qhost-xhtml.xsl
  * qlic-xhtml.xsl
  * qstat-xhtml.xsl
  * qstatf-xhtml.xsl
  * qstatf-psp.xsl
  * qstatj-xhtml.xsl


For general actions, no particular convention has been used:

  * extract-query.xsl
  * info-to-xhtml.xsl

  * rss.xml
  * feed-atom-overview.xsl
