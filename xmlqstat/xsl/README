This directory contains XSLT transformations.

Third-party transformations are included in subdirectories:

  * exslt-templates/
    used for converting epoch values to date/times

Boilerplate and templates with named transforms are prefixed with 'xmlqstat-':

  * xmlqstat-masthead.xsl
  * xmlqstat-templates.xsl

In general, the naming convention 'SOURCE-DEST.xsl' is chosen.
If a particular rendering mode cannot be easily dealt within the same
transformation, the naming convention 'SOURCE-MODE-DEST.xsl' is used.


  * qhost-xhtml.xsl
  * qlic-xhtml.xsl
  * qstatf-xhtml.xsl
  * qstatj-xhtml.xsl
  * qstat-xhtml.xsl


For the balance, no particular convention has been used.

  * index-xhtml.xsl
  * directory-xhtml.xsl
  * feed-atom-overview.xsl
  * info-to-xhtml.xsl

Utility templates (likely cocoon-only)

  * cocoon/error404.xsl
    a simpler error page than getting a cocoon stack trace

  * cocoon/redirect-query.xsl
    extract cluster root/cell from config.xml and redirect to another url

  * cocoon/prune-cachedir-listing.xsl
    prune directory listing to retain
    cache/*.xml, cache-{clusterName}/*.xml files

  * cocoon/attach-stylesheet.xsl
    add <?xslt-param ..?> and <?xml-stylesheet .. ?> to an xml file


Utility templates

  * pi-param.xsl
    extract mozilla-style processing instructions for client-side XSLT
