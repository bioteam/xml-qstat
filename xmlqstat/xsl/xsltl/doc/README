This directory contains support stylesheets for generating the
documentation set for the XSLT Standard Library.  The document
'build.xml' describes the source stylesheets and documents.

Prerequisites
=============

The DocBook stylesheets must be installed in ../../docbook/dbx.
Ie. ../../docbook/dbx/html/docbook.xsl must exist.

Processing
==========

Generating the documentation set is a two-step process:

1. Extract the DocBook from the stylesheets using the stylesheet
   allxsl2jref.xsl with build.xml as the source document.
   Saxon is recommended for this task, as Gnome libxslt (1.0.9)
   has a problem with the xsl2jref.xsl stylesheet.

   For example:

   java -jar .../saxon.jar allxsl2jref.xsl build.xml

2. Convert DocBook to HTML using the makehtml.xsl stylesheet
   with build.xml as the source document.

   For example:

   xsltproc makehtml.xsl build.xml
