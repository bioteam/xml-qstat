~check MFALSE

User-customizable functions that you can use to change and modify HTTPi's
internal messages, and carry them across upgrades, new in 1.5.

hterror is the central routine. If you want additional customization,
you can also change hterror301 and hterror404. However, hterror's arguments
should not be changed as other subroutines call it for their error handling.
